# Interactive-QA-Bot-Using-BERT-Pinecone-and-Gradio
This project is an interactive QA bot that processes PDF documents and answers questions based on the content. It uses BERT for text embeddings, Pinecone for vector search, and Cohere for text generation. With a Gradio interface, users can upload PDFs and get answers to their queries.
